WUS-001: Date Navigation & Local Date Fix
================================================================================
SWUS: 2026-01-07 Wednesday 05:30:00 PST
Branch: main

OBJECTIVE:
Fix issue where app was showing wrong date (Jan 6 instead of Jan 7) and implement
previous/next day navigation for browsing daily activities.

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. ✅ Identified timezone issue - toISOString() returns UTC, not local date
2. ✅ Fixed date calculation in useActivities.ts to use local date:
   - Created getCurrentLocalDate() helper function
   - Returns YYYY-MM-DD in user's local timezone (not UTC)
3. ✅ Implemented day navigation in TodaysActivities.tsx:
   - "Previous Day" button (navigate backward)
   - "Next Day" button (navigate forward)
   - "Today" button (return to current day, only shows when not on today)
4. ✅ Modified useActivities hook to accept optional date parameter
5. ✅ Tested: App now correctly shows January 7, 2026 (Wednesday)
6. ✅ Created /local folder structure for project SOPs and logging
7. ✅ Created user-agent_sops_kadjot.txt with project-specific SOPs

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
Files Modified:
- lib/hooks/useActivities.ts
  * Added getCurrentLocalDate() function for timezone-safe date calculation
  * Removed useState/useEffect caching (caused stale date issues)
  * Accept optional date parameter for navigation
  
- components/dashboard/TodaysActivities.tsx
  * Added displayDate state for navigation
  * Added navigateDay('prev'|'next') and goToToday() functions
  * Added navigation buttons UI below activity list
  * Pass date prop to useActivities hook

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Critical Fix: Always use local date for user-facing date displays
- UTC vs Local: toISOString() can show wrong date for users ahead of UTC
- Navigation Pattern: State management in parent component, prop drilling to hooks

FILES CREATED:
- /local/user-agent_sops_kadjot.txt (SOPs for kadjot-next project)
- /local/wus/wus_2026-01-07.txt (this file)
- /local/env_log.txt (environment setup commands)

CURRENT STATE:
✅ App displays correct local date (January 7, 2026)
✅ Users can navigate to previous/next days
✅ Activities update correctly based on selected date
✅ "Today" button appears when viewing past/future days
✅ All functionality tested and working in browser
✅ Local folder structure created with SOPs and logs

NEXT AGENT:
- Branch: main
- App running on: Frontend (localhost:3001), Backend (localhost:3000)
- Ready for next feature or commit/push to GitHub

WUS-002: Fix Days Counter Display
================================================================================
SWUS: 2026-01-07 Wednesday 06:00:00 PST
Branch: main

OBJECTIVE:
Fix "Days Completed" counter showing incorrect total: "1 of 2 days" should be 
"1 of 84 days" (12 weeks × 7 days).

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- daysInProgram was calculating days SINCE program started (2)
- Should show TOTAL program length (84 days)
- Inconsistent with text "Complete all 12 weeks (84 days) to finish"

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. ✅ Identified issue in lib/hooks/useProgramStats.ts
2. ✅ Changed daysInProgram from dynamic calculation to constant 84
3. ✅ Tested: Counter now shows "1 of 84 days in program"
4. ✅ Verified consistency with overall progress text

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
Files Modified:
- lib/hooks/useProgramStats.ts
  * Changed daysInProgram to return constant 84
  * Removed getDaysSinceStart() call (was incorrect context)
  * Simplified useMemo to just return program total length

BEFORE:
```typescript
const daysInProgram = useMemo(() => {
  if (!programData.startDate || !isProgramStarted) return 0;
  return getDaysSinceStart(programData.startDate);
}, [programData.startDate, isProgramStarted]);
```

AFTER:
```typescript
const daysInProgram = useMemo(() => {
  return 84; // 12 weeks × 7 days = 84 days total program length
}, []);
```

CURRENT STATE:
✅ Days counter displays: "1 of 84 days in program"
✅ Consistent with "Complete all 12 weeks (84 days)" text
✅ Properly represents total program duration
✅ All functionality tested and verified in browser

WUS-003: Fix Activity Status - Date-Aware Logic
================================================================================
SWUS: 2026-01-07 Wednesday 06:10:00 PST
Branch: main

OBJECTIVE:
Fix activity status to be date-aware. Future days were showing "missed" status 
for activities that haven't happened yet because status calculation only checked 
time of day, not the actual date.

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- getActivityStatus() only compared current time vs activity time
- Didn't check which date the activity was for
- Future days with early morning activities showed as "missed"
- Past days all showing correct "missed" for incomplete activities

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. ✅ Modified getActivityStatus() to accept activityDate parameter
2. ✅ Added date comparison logic:
   - Future dates: all activities = "upcoming"
   - Past dates: incomplete activities = "missed"
   - Today: time-based status (upcoming/ongoing/missed)
3. ✅ Updated useActivities hook to pass date to getActivityStatus
4. ✅ Added getCurrentLocalDate() helper function
5. ✅ Tested: Future activities (Jan 8) now correctly show "Upcoming"

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
Files Modified:
- lib/utils/activityHelpers.ts
  * Added activityDate optional parameter to getActivityStatus()
  * Added date comparison logic before time comparison
  * Added getCurrentLocalDate() helper function
  * Future dates: return 'upcoming'
  * Past dates: return 'missed'
  * Today: use existing time-window logic

- lib/hooks/useActivities.ts
  * Pass todayKey (date) as 4th parameter to getActivityStatus()
  * Ensures each activity knows what date it belongs to

BEFORE (Time-only logic):
- Future day 6:00 AM activity at 8:00 PM = "missed" ❌
- Today 6:00 AM activity at 8:00 PM = "missed" ✅

AFTER (Date-aware logic):
- Future day 6:00 AM activity at 8:00 PM = "upcoming" ✅
- Today 6:00 AM activity at 8:00 PM = "missed" ✅

CURRENT STATE:
✅ Future activities show "Upcoming" badge (yellow)
✅ Past incomplete activities show "Missed" badge (amber)
✅ Today's activities use time-based status correctly
✅ Navigation between dates works properly
✅ All date-related status logic is consistent

- App running on: Frontend (localhost:3001), Backend (localhost:3000)
- Ready for commit & push

WUS-004: Fix Calendar Export - Share Display Date
================================================================================
SWUS: 2026-01-07 Wednesday 06:20:00 PST
Branch: main

OBJECTIVE:
Fix calendar export always downloading January 6 entries. QuickActions component
was not aware of the selected date in TodaysActivities component (they were siblings).

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- TodaysActivities had its own displayDate state
- QuickActions always used useActivities() without date parameter
- When user navigated to future/past days, calendar export still exported today's activities
- Siblings don't share state

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. ✅ Lifted displayDate state to parent component (app/page.tsx)
2. ✅ Passed displayDate and setDisplayDate as props to TodaysActivities
3. ✅ Passed displayDate as prop to QuickActions
4. ✅ Updated QuickActions to use displayDate in useActivities() call
5. ✅ Updated generateCalendarEvent() to use displayDate instead of "today"
6. ✅ Updated generateDailyPlan() to use displayDate instead of "today"
7. ✅ Fixed all date references in ICS file generation

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
Files Modified:
- app/page.tsx
  * Added displayDate state (using getCurrentLocalDate())
  * Pass displayDate and setDisplayDate to TodaysActivities
  * Pass displayDate to QuickActions

- components/dashboard/TodaysActivities.tsx
  * Accept displayDate and setDisplayDate as props
  * Remove internal selectedDate state
  * Use props instead of internal state
  * Updated navigation handlers to use setDisplayDate

- components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx
  * Accept displayDate as prop
  * Pass displayDate to useActivities({ date: displayDate })
  * Use displayDate in calendar event generation (eventDate, not "today")
  * Use displayDate in daily plan generation (planDate, not "today")
  * Updated filename generation to use correct date

BEFORE:
- Navigate to Jan 8 (tomorrow)
- Click "Export to Calendar"
- Downloads: kadjot-tuesday-2026-01-06.ics ❌ (wrong date!)

AFTER:
- Navigate to Jan 8 (tomorrow)
- Click "Export to Calendar"
- Downloads: kadjot-wednesday-2026-01-08.ics ✅ (correct date!)

CURRENT STATE:
✅ Calendar export uses correct displayed date
✅ Daily plan export uses correct displayed date
✅ All date references consistent across components
✅ State properly lifted to parent component
